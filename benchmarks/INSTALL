Jmod benchmarks
===============

The package ch.epfl.lis.jmod.benchmarks includes the following classes for generating community detection benchmarks:

* CliqueRingBenchmark
* ErdosRenyiBenchmark
* LFRBenchmark

The header of each class provides detailed information about the implementation of the benchmarks and how to run them. Note that their execution benefit from multiple processors in order to generate faster large number of benchmark networks.

Installing LFR binaries
-----------------------

LFRBenchmark requires the installation of Andrea Lancichinetti's binaries for generating LFR benchmarks. There are in total four binaries to install for generating:

* Undirected and unweighted LFR graphs (binary_networks.tar.gz)

1. Download the four archives from Andrea Lancichinetti's website and place them in the 'benchmarks' directory located at the root of this project
  * [binary_networks.tar.gz](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/files/binary_networks.tar.gz)
  * [directed_networks.tar.gz](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/files/directed_networks.tar.gz)
  * [weighted_directed_nets.tar.gz](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/files/weighted_directed_nets.tar.gz)
  * [weighted_networks.tar.gz](https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/files/weighted_networks.tar.gz)
2. Go to the 'benchmarks' directory and run './install.sh' (requires execution permission)
3. Done
